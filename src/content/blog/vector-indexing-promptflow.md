For a long time, I relied heavily on [AutoMapper](https://automapper.org/) in my projects. Itâ€™s a great library, no doubt about it. However, after the recent [license changes](https://www.jimmybogard.com/automapper-and-mediatr-licensing-update/), I started exploring alternatives.

I even went as far as mapping objects manuallyâ€”while that approach works and removes any external dependencies, the drawbacks quickly add up. In large codebases where models evolve frequently, maintaining all those manual mappings becomes a real headache.

Thatâ€™s why I decided to build something lightweight and easy to use. And thatâ€™s how [TacoMapper](https://barrientos.io/TacoMapper) was born.

### How do I try TacoMapper?

The good news is, [TacoMapper is available on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TacoMapper), so installing it is as easy as:

```bash
dotnet add package TacoMapper --version 1.0.1 # The latest version as of today.
```

Once installed, you can start mapping objects using the `ObjectMapper` (Iâ€™ll probably rename this class soonâ€”it predates the library name ðŸ˜…):

```csharp
var personDto = ObjectMapper.Map<Person, PersonDto>(person);
```

You can also use a fluent API to define your mappings in a more expressive way:

```csharp
var mapper = ObjectMapper.Create<Person, PersonDto>()
    .Map(dest => dest.Id, src => src.Id)
    .Map(dest => dest.Email, src => src.Email)
    .Map(dest => dest.Age, src => src.DateOfBirth, dob => DateTime.Now.Year - dob.Year)
    .Map(dest => dest.Status, src => src.IsActive, active => active ? "Active" : "Inactive")
    .Combine(dest => dest.FullName, src => $"{src.FirstName} {src.LastName}");

var result = mapper.MapFrom(person);
```

### Documentation

[TacoMapper](https://barrientos.io/TacoMapper) comes with clean, minimal documentation built entirely with [StarLight](https://starlight.astro.build/). You can check it out at: [https://barrientos.io/TacoMapper](https://barrientos.io/TacoMapper)

### Whatâ€™s next?

While [TacoMapper](https://barrientos.io/TacoMapper) is already up and running, thereâ€™s still plenty to improveâ€”things like support for dependency injection and other nice-to-have features. The library is actively being developed, so if this project caught your attention and youâ€™d like to contribute, head over to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/tavobarrientos/TacoMapper) and send a pull request!
